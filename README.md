# Refactoring the webpage Horiseon

## Description
I wanted to make sure that all links  on the page are functioning correctly. Also, to rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Credit
I benefitted from using stackoverflow and my tutor when making changes on the html file and css file
